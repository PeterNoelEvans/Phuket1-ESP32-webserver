# Phuket1-ESP32-webserver
code to build an ESP32 webserver to allow you to turn on and off one LED via a phone or web browswer.

You will only need these two files.

Note that you will have to change the pin number from the ????? on line 29 of boot.py file.
You will also have to change the ssid and password to those of the local server. See line 15 and 16 of boot.py file.
When completed, wire up an LED to a pin on your ESP32 and either on a mobile phone or web browser type in the IP address that is displayed after booting the ESP32. This will allow you to turn on and off the LED.
